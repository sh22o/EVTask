## Description
E-Commerce Product is a simple application built with Next.js that features a welcoming home page with a call-to-action button leading to a product listing. Each product card in the list provides a link to a dynamically routed single product page, showcasing detailed information about the selected product.

## Features
-Fetches Product Data: Utilizes the Fake Store API to fetch product details.
-Product Display: Shows product image, title, price, and rating in a clean card format.
-Responsive Layout: Implemented with Tailwind CSS to ensure the app is visually appealing on all devices.
-Loading Indicator: Displays a spinner while data is being fetched to enhance user experience.
-Error Handling: Basic error management to inform users if data fetching fails.
-Dynamic Routing: Allows navigation to individual product pages based on product ID.
Technologies Used
-Next.js: A React framework for building server-rendered applications.
-Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the application.

## Challenges Faced
During the development of this project, I encountered a few challenges:
Asynchronous Data Fetching: Managing state during data fetching and ensuring a responsive UI was tricky initially. I resolved this by implementing loading indicators and error handling.
Dynamic Routing: Setting up dynamic routes for individual product pages required careful configuration, which I overcame by following Next.js documentation and tutorials.
